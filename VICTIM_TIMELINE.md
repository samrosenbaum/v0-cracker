# Victim's Last Known Movements - Timeline Reconstruction

## üéØ Overview

The victim's last 24-48 hours are THE MOST CRITICAL period in any homicide investigation. This system uses AI to reconstruct every movement, identify timeline gaps, track who they encountered, and highlight areas requiring investigation.

**Why This Matters:**
- Last person to see victim alive is often perpetrator or key witness
- Timeline gaps often indicate when crime occurred
- Deviations from routine suggest motive or planning
- Digital/physical evidence trails are strongest in this period
- Witnesses are most reliable about recent events

---

## üîç What This System Does

### 1. **Complete Timeline Reconstruction**

Extracts and organizes every confirmed or reported movement:

```
‚úÖ Where victim was
‚úÖ When (exact time or estimate)
‚úÖ What they were doing
‚úÖ Who saw them
‚úÖ Who was with them
‚úÖ What evidence supports this
‚úÖ Confidence level (exact/approximate/estimated)
```

**Example Timeline Entry:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T19:45:00",
  "timestampConfidence": "exact",
  "location": "Starbucks on Main St",
  "locationConfidence": "exact",
  "activity": "Purchased coffee, sat at table near window",
  "witnessedBy": ["Barista Sarah Johnson", "Customer Mike Chen"],
  "accompaniedBy": ["Friend Jessica Martinez"],
  "evidence": [
    "Credit card receipt 7:45 PM",
    "Security camera footage",
    "Barista statement"
  ],
  "significance": "high"
}
```

---

### 2. **Timeline Gap Detection** üö®

Automatically identifies periods where victim's whereabouts are unknown.

**Gap Analysis Includes:**
- Duration of gap (minutes/hours)
- Last known location before gap
- Next known location after gap
- Significance level (critical/high/medium/low)
- Investigation priority score
- Questions that need answers
- Evidence that could fill the gap
- Potential witnesses to locate

**Critical Gap Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL 3-HOUR GAP

From: 8:00 PM at friend's house
To: 11:00 PM found at scene
Duration: 3 hours

Questions:
- How did victim travel from friend's house to scene?
- Who did victim encounter during this time?
- Where was victim's phone during gap?

Evidence to Collect:
- Security cameras along route
- Cell tower records
- Witness canvass of area
- Traffic camera footage
```

**Gap Significance Levels:**
- **Critical** (4+ hours): Major unaccounted period
- **High** (2-4 hours): Significant gap needing investigation
- **Medium** (1-2 hours): Notable gap
- **Low** (<1 hour): Minor gap

---

### 3. **Last Seen Persons Tracking** üë•

Identifies and prioritizes everyone who saw victim near the time of incident.

**Tracked Information:**
- Name and relationship to victim
- Exact time of last contact
- Location of encounter
- Circumstances of meeting
- Victim's behavior/mood
- Person's behavior
- Witness accounts corroborating this
- Investigation status (interviewed? cleared? suspect?)
- Red flags or suspicious behavior

**Priority Levels:**
- **Critical**: Last person to see victim alive, or within 1 hour of incident
- **High**: Saw victim within 3 hours of incident
- **Medium**: Saw victim within 6 hours
- **Low**: Saw victim 6-24 hours before

**Red Flags Detected:**
- Person's account contradicts physical evidence
- Person has motive
- Person's behavior was unusual
- Person's alibi for later time is weak
- Person avoided mentioning this encounter initially
- Person downplays relationship with victim

**Example:**
```
üö© CRITICAL - LAST SEEN PERSON

Name: Michael Thompson
Relationship: Ex-boyfriend
Last Contact: 10:30 PM (30 min before estimated TOD)
Location: Parking lot near scene

Circumstances: "Just happened to run into her"

RED FLAGS:
- Claimed they're "friends" but victim's diary shows recent conflict
- Can't explain why he was in that area at that time
- Phone location data contradicts his stated movements
- Witness saw them arguing, but Michael says "brief chat"

Investigation Status: NOT YET INTERVIEWED
Priority: CRITICAL

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Immediate re-interview with confrontational questions about:
1. True nature of relationship
2. What they argued about
3. Where he went after parking lot
4. Why his phone was off after 10:45 PM
```

---

### 4. **Routine Deviation Analysis**

Compares victim's actual movements to their typical routine.

**Detects:**
- Went somewhere unusual
- Met someone unexpected
- Changed normal schedule
- Missed typical activities
- Made unusual purchases
- Contacted someone repeatedly

**Why Deviations Matter:**
- Could indicate meeting with perpetrator
- Might show awareness of danger
- Could reveal secret relationship
- May indicate being followed
- Might show response to threat

**Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è ROUTINE DEVIATION DETECTED

Type: Location
Description: Victim went to warehouse district at 9 PM

Normal Routine: "Never goes to that area, especially at night"
Actual Behavior: "Drove directly to abandoned warehouse on 5th St"

Significance:
This is a major deviation. Victim typically stays in residential areas
after dark. Warehouse district is industrial, poorly lit, no reason for
victim to be there. Suggests she was meeting someone or lured there.

Investigation Needed:
1. Check victim's communications for meeting arrangements
2. Traffic cameras showing if victim was following another vehicle
3. Witness canvass - did anyone see victim or another vehicle?
4. Phone records - was victim calling/texted during drive there?
5. Search warehouse for evidence of meeting or crime scene
```

---

### 5. **Encountered Persons List**

Everyone victim interacted with during the critical period.

**Categories:**
- **Known to victim**: Friends, family, coworkers
- **Stranger**: Random encounters
- **Service worker**: Cashier, gas station attendant, etc.
- **Passerby**: Saw but didn't interact directly

**Interaction Types:**
- Conversation
- Transaction
- Passing/Brief
- Conflict

**Example:**
```
ENCOUNTERED PERSON #7

Name: Unknown male (gas station)
Role: Stranger
Time: 8:15 PM
Location: Shell station, Route 12
Interaction: Conversation in parking lot

Witness (gas station attendant): "Saw victim talking to a guy by the
air pump. He approached her, they talked for maybe 2-3 minutes. She
looked uncomfortable. White male, 30s, baseball cap, drove gray sedan."

Victim Reaction: "Looked uncomfortable, kept stepping back"
Person Behavior: "Kept moving closer to her, gesturing"

Follow-up Needed: YES - CRITICAL
Investigation Notes:
- Get full surveillance footage
- Enhance video to get license plate
- Attendant should view photo lineup
- This could be perpetrator making initial contact
```

### 6. **Critical Areas Needing Investigation** üìç

Locations that require closer examination.

**Identified When:**
- Victim spent significant time there
- Timeline gap occurred there
- Suspicious encounter happened there
- Evidence should exist but is missing
- Multiple witnesses mention the location

**For Each Area:**
- Why it's critical
- What evidence is available
- What evidence is missing
- What witnesses are needed
- Specific investigation actions with priorities

**Example:**
```
üîç CRITICAL AREA: Park & Ride Lot, Exit 45

Time Range: 9:30 PM - 10:15 PM (45 min)

Why Critical:
Victim's car found here next morning. Phone last pinged tower nearby at
9:47 PM. Witness saw victim's car in lot around 10 PM. This is likely
where victim was intercepted or met perpetrator.

Evidence Available:
- Victim's abandoned car (processed)
- Phone records showing last tower ping
- One witness saw car in lot

Evidence MISSING (Critical):
- Surveillance footage (lot has cameras but "not working")
- Witness statements from other vehicles in lot
- Traffic camera footage from exit ramp
- Victim's phone (never recovered)

Investigation Actions:

1. [CRITICAL] Subpoena surveillance footage from nearby businesses
   Priority: Critical
   Effort: 2-3 days
   Could Show: Who victim met, what vehicle they left in

2. [CRITICAL] Re-canvass for witnesses in lot that night
   Priority: Critical
   Effort: 1 week
   Could Show: Who was there, what they saw

3. [HIGH] Check traffic cameras on highway approach
   Priority: High
   Effort: 1-2 days
   Could Show: If victim was followed to lot

4. [HIGH] Analyze victim's car for forensic evidence
   Priority: High
   Effort: 2 weeks
   Could Show: Evidence of perpetrator (DNA, fingerprints)
```

### 7. **Digital Footprint Analysis** üì±

Analyzes victim's digital trail during critical period.

**Data Sources:**
- Phone records (calls, texts)
- Cell tower location data
- Social media activity
- Email communications
- Credit card transactions
- ATM withdrawals
- App usage (Uber, etc.)

**Identifies:**
- Last communications
- Location tracking
- Unusual contacts
- Distress signals in messages
- Sudden silence in normally active accounts
- Transactions out of character

**Example:**
```
LAST COMMUNICATION

Type: Text message
Time: 10:12 PM
To: Sister (Amy)
Content: "Heading home now, traffic is bad. Love you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Mood: Normal, affectionate

SIGNIFICANCE:
This was victim's LAST communication. 13 minutes later, her phone went
offline at 10:25 PM and never came back online. She never made it home.

Timeline: 10:12 PM message ‚Üí 10:25 PM phone goes dark ‚Üí 10:30 PM estimated TOD

This 18-minute window is CRITICAL.

SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED:

1. Unknown Number Calls
   9:45 PM: Incoming call from unknown number (555-0142), duration 47 sec
   Victim answered. No other calls to/from this number before.

   ACTION: Subpoena records for 555-0142 immediately

2. Location Data Anomaly
   Phone location shows victim near Park & Ride lot 9:47-10:25 PM
   BUT victim told sister "heading home now" at 10:12 PM

   CONTRADICTION: Why did victim say heading home but stayed in lot?
   Was she waiting for someone? Was she held there?

3. Failed Uber Request
   10:08 PM: Victim opened Uber app, searched for ride, but canceled

   SIGNIFICANCE: Why? Was someone else offering her a ride?
   Did she see someone she knew?
```

### 8. **Witness Account Validation** ‚úÖ

Cross-references witness statements with physical and digital evidence.

**Validates:**
- Does witness timeline match physical evidence?
- Does location match phone data?
- Does description match other witnesses?
- Are there internal inconsistencies?

**Credibility Scoring:**
- Supporting evidence vs contradicting evidence
- Consistency with known facts
- Witness motivation to lie
- Details that can be verified

**Example:**
```
WITNESS: Tom Bradley (neighbor)

Claimed Sighting:
"I saw Sarah walking her dog past my house around 9 PM on March 15th.
She waved at me. She was wearing a blue jacket."

VALIDATION:

Supporting Evidence:
‚úÖ Victim did walk dog most evenings (routine confirmed)
‚úÖ Blue jacket matches jacket found at scene
‚úÖ Tom has clear view of sidewalk from his porch

Contradicting Evidence:
‚ùå Victim's phone location shows she was 2 miles away at 9 PM
‚ùå Security camera at victim's house shows she left for walk at 9:30 PM, not 9 PM
‚ùå Another neighbor (verified by camera) confirms seeing victim at 9:30, not 9:00

Credibility Score: 0.3/1.0 (Low)

Inconsistencies:
- Time is off by 30 minutes
- Could be honest mistake about time
- OR witness is lying about when he saw her

Recommendation: QUESTIONABLE - Needs Verification

Verification Steps:
1. Re-interview Tom, show him phone data
2. Could he have seen her at 9:30 and just misremembered time?
3. Why is the time discrepancy exactly 30 minutes?
4. Check Tom's own phone location data for 9-9:30 PM
5. Does Tom have any connection to victim beyond "neighbor"?
```

## üéì Why This Solves Cases

**The victim's last movements tell the story:**

‚úÖ Shows who had opportunity (last person seen with)
‚úÖ Reveals motive (routine deviations, conflicts)
‚úÖ Identifies when crime occurred (timeline gaps)
‚úÖ Provides evidence trail (digital footprint)
‚úÖ Catches lies (witness validation)
‚úÖ Highlights investigation priorities (critical areas)

**Most cold cases are solved by:**
1. Finding one overlooked witness from victim's last hours ‚Üí ‚úÖ We identify them
2. Spotting timeline inconsistency in suspect's story ‚Üí ‚úÖ We detect gaps
3. Discovering hidden digital evidence ‚Üí ‚úÖ We analyze footprint
4. Realizing victim deviated from routine (went to meet someone) ‚Üí ‚úÖ We flag deviations
