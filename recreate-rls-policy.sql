-- This file previously recreated auth-based RLS policies that BLOCK anonymous users
-- Since authentication is disabled in the app, we need anonymous-friendly policies
-- See DATABASE-RLS-IMPORTANT.md for explanation

-- If you need to recreate policies, use EMERGENCY-FIX.sql which has the correct
-- anonymous-friendly policies that work with the current app configuration
